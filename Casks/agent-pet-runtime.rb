  caveats <<~EOS
    Agent Pet Runtime is ad-hoc signed rather than notarised. If Gatekeeper
    still objects:
      xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/AgentPet.app"
    or right-click the app, choose Open, then Open again.

    It lives in the menu bar. Connect an agent before it will react to
    anything:
      "#{appdir}/AgentPet.app/Contents/MacOS/AgentPet" --configure claude-code

    Uninstalling does not remove the hooks it wrote into your agents'
    configuration files. Remove those first, or they will keep running a
    shim that is no longer installed:
      "#{appdir}/AgentPet.app/Contents/MacOS/AgentPet" --unconfigure claude-code
  EOS
