  # Deliberately no install steps here.
  #
  # This cask used to strip `com.apple.quarantine` in a `postflight_steps`
  # block, on the theory that a downloaded copy arrives quarantined and
  # Gatekeeper then calls an ad-hoc signed bundle damaged. It does not:
  # Homebrew downloads with curl, and nothing quarantines that — in Homebrew's
  # own code `Quarantine.propagate` returns early unless the container it just
  # unpacked already carries the attribute, and `Quarantine.cask!` is an empty
  # stub — so the step was a no-op on every install it ever ran in.
  #
  # What it did do is pin the cask to `run`, an install step Homebrew only
  # added on 2026-07-26: on anything older, the cask failed to load at all. A
  # cask that uses nothing but stanzas loads on every version, which is worth
  # more than a command that never ran.
  #
  # The Gatekeeper case is real for a copy that *was* quarantined — downloaded
  # through a browser, or dragged out of the zip in Finder — and the caveats
  # below carry the one-line fix for it.

  # Stop the running pet before the bundle is replaced. Without this the old
  # binary keeps running from memory, holding the bridge socket, so hook events
  # go to a process whose files are gone and the update waits for a restart
  # that may be days away.
  #
  # `quit:` asks over an AppleEvent, which macOS permits only from a terminal
  # that has been granted automation access. Nobody grants it, so in practice
  # brew warns that the application did not quit and carries on — and that is
  # also why `signal:` is here: it finds the process through NSWorkspace and
  # sends SIGTERM, neither of which needs permission. The app turns SIGTERM
  # into a normal quit (it saves its window position and closes its socket).
  #
  # `on_upgrade:` is load-bearing: Homebrew skips signals during an upgrade by
  # default, on the assumption that the polite quit worked.
  #
  # This cannot be a `preflight_steps` run: cask install steps execute inside
  # Homebrew's seatbelt profile, which denies AppleEvents, process listing
  # (pgrep fails with "Cannot get process list") and LaunchServices. The
  # uninstall stanzas run outside it.

  caveats <<~EOS
    Agent Pet Runtime is ad-hoc signed rather than notarised. If Gatekeeper
    still objects:
      xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/AgentPet.app"
    or right-click the app, choose Open, then Open again.

    It lives in the menu bar. Connect an agent before it will react to
    anything:
      "#{appdir}/AgentPet.app/Contents/MacOS/AgentPet" --configure claude-code

    Uninstalling does not remove what it installed into your agents — the
    hook lines it wrote into their configuration files, nor the extension
    files it put in ~/.pi/agent/extensions and ~/.omp/agent/extensions.
    Remove those first, or they will keep running a shim that is no longer
    installed:
      "#{appdir}/AgentPet.app/Contents/MacOS/AgentPet" --unconfigure claude-code
      "#{appdir}/AgentPet.app/Contents/MacOS/AgentPet" --unconfigure pi
      "#{appdir}/AgentPet.app/Contents/MacOS/AgentPet" --unconfigure omp
