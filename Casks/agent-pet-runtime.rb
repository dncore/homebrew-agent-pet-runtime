  # The app is ad-hoc signed, not notarised, so macOS quarantines it on
  # download and Gatekeeper reports it as damaged. Stripping the attribute on
  # install is what makes a downloaded copy behave like a built one.

  # Stop the running pet before the bundle is replaced. Without this the old
  # binary keeps running from memory, holding the bridge socket, so hook events
  # go to a process whose files are gone and the update waits for a restart
  # that may be days away.
  #
  # `quit:` asks over an AppleEvent, which macOS permits only from a terminal
  # that has been granted automation access. Nobody grants it, so in practice
  # brew warns that the application did not quit and carries on — and that is
  # also why `signal:` is here: it finds the process through NSWorkspace and
  # sends SIGTERM, neither of which needs permission. The app turns SIGTERM
  # into a normal quit (it saves its window position and closes its socket).
  #
  # `on_upgrade:` is load-bearing: Homebrew skips signals during an upgrade by
  # default, on the assumption that the polite quit worked.
  #
  # This cannot be a `preflight_steps` run: cask install steps execute inside
  # Homebrew's seatbelt profile, which denies AppleEvents, process listing
  # (pgrep fails with "Cannot get process list") and LaunchServices. The
  # uninstall stanzas run outside it.

  caveats <<~EOS
    Agent Pet Runtime is ad-hoc signed rather than notarised. If Gatekeeper
    still objects:
      xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/AgentPet.app"
    or right-click the app, choose Open, then Open again.

    It lives in the menu bar. Connect an agent before it will react to
    anything:
      "#{appdir}/AgentPet.app/Contents/MacOS/AgentPet" --configure claude-code

    Uninstalling does not remove the hooks it wrote into your agents'
    configuration files. Remove those first, or they will keep running a
    shim that is no longer installed:
      "#{appdir}/AgentPet.app/Contents/MacOS/AgentPet" --unconfigure claude-code
  EOS
